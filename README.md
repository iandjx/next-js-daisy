# NEXT-JS, TAILWINDCSS, TWIN.MACRO, DAISYUI, Typescript Template

## Why?

Tailwind CSS has been a game changer in speeding up design implementation due to its declarative approach.
Twin.macro has helped bring in the functionality of styled-components to help developer easily create reusable components.
Daisy UI brings in a set of ready made tailwind components that can be customized easily.

By using all 3 at the same time, allows us to use Daisy UI components as templates in building reusable components because we can easily switch from imperative and declarative css properties.

It brings the flexibility of not being tied to one UI framework because we dont need to force ourselves to use a Daisy UI button when we need a more customizable one.
